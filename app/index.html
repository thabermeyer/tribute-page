          <p>Mori is considered one of the leading writers of the Meiji period (1868 - 1912), the time during which Japan rapidly transformed from an isolated feudal society to a modern, Westernized nation.</p>
          <p>Though a medical doctor by profession, Mori's literary career can be traced to his decision to enlist in the Imperial Japanese Army in 1882, which sent him abroad to Germany to study. While at school and abroad he read widely, studying extensively from the late-Edo period popular novels of Japan, taking lessons in Chinese poetry and literature, and exploring the then-unknown world of European literature.</p>
          <p>Upon his return to Japan, in addition to pursuing his career in medicine, he published his own literary journal, a handful of short stories, and his own book of poetry. Proficient in German, he produced translations of Goethe, Schiller, Ibsen, Hans Christian Andersen, and Hauptmann.</p>
          <p>Mori did not begin writing more extensively until around 1905, when his output of short stories and essays increased considerably. He wrote his first novel, <em>Vita Sexualis</em>, in 1909, and would go on to write three more novels, including his most renowned, <em>The Wild Geese</em>, in 1913. After the death of Emperor Meiji in 1912, he turned his focus to historical stories, which would occupy his interest until the end of his life.</p>
          <p>Mori's influence on modern Japanese literature cannot be understated, and his works continue to have resonance among readers today.</p>
